# resume

LaTeX resume template, perhaps, one day, an orgmode export option??

This is my resume. Feel free to use it as a template, 
just be careful not to accidentally leave my information in. 
You don't want to submit my resume for yourself. That would be awkward.

I'm using a constants.tex file alongside the main one to avoid putting my personal info online.  
I'll commit a foo'd version of it so that you can do the same if you want.

If editing this is your first time using LaTeX, note that the whitespace is significant, 
from what I can tell - the empty lines I have in it are required.

Compile it on every line change, and be careful that you're getting what you expect.

I presume if you're conscientious enough to figure out how on your own, 
you'll be conscientious enough to only use your own info.

I hope as a template, this serves you well.

Cheers!
